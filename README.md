#To-dos:

- basic portfolio visualisation and optimisation
- what is the difference between "close" and "adj close"?
- make sure these are the funds you would actually consider buying
- expand the analysed portfolio with additional ETFs

To-dos (later):
- translate all currencies to PLN
- introduce the notion of transaction costs when buying new ETFs (price of a single ETF, transaction fees)
