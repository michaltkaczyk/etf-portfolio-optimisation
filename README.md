# About
This is an attempt at portfolio optimisation based on ETFs.

# ETF pre-selection
I selected ETFs which are available on my local platform (mBank) and are accumulative (in order ot avoid having to include profit information in tax form).

The list of pre-selected ETFs as of now is:
- iShares Physical Gold ETC (`SGLN.L`), traded in GBP
- iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc), (`SWDA.L`) traded in GBP
- SPDR MSCI Europe Energy UCITS ETF (`STNX.SW`), traded in CHF
- WisdomTree Physical Precious Metals (`PHPM.L`), traded in USD
- SPDR S&P US Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF (`SPYD.DE`), traded in EUR

# Learnings
- "Adjusted close" and "close" price are one and the same for me, as long as I am onlu using accumulative ETFs.

# To-do's:
- ~~basic portfolio visualisation and optimisation~~
- ~~what is the difference between "close" and "adj close"~~?
- ~~make sure these are the funds you would actually consider buying~~
- ~~expand the analysed portfolio with additional ETFs~~
- ~~translate all currencies to PLN~~
- ~~introduce the notion of transaction costs when buying new ETFs (price of a single ETF)~~
- expand the notion of transaction costs - fees, money already allocated
